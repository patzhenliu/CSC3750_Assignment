            Charlotte's Sweets Shop was opened on December 19, 2013. Charlotte grew up in the city of
            Mitakihara, Japan. She was always <em>determined</em> and <em>worked hard</em> to get what she wanted.
            She had an immense talent for baking sweets at the young age of 8 years old. Her aunt,
            Mami Tomoe, saw this potential in her and opened up Charlotte's Sweets Shop to share her
            desserts with the world. Unfortunately, Charlotte passed away a few years later.
            Ms. Tomoe continued to run the shop in honor of his late sister. The specialty of the shop
            are cheese themed desserts since cheese was always Charlotte's favorite.

                <p>
                    This is one of Ms. Tomoe's favorite dishes and it's very simple to prepare.
                    <blockquote>"We recommend you eat it alongside some fruity tea. Our personal favorite is apricot tea; perfect for the spring!"</blockquote>

                    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>24oz. cream cheese</li>
                        <li>1 1/3 cup granulated sugar</li>
                        <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
                        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
                        <li>2 tsp lemon juice</li>
                        <li>1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs</li>
                        <li>5 tsb melted butter</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Let the ingredients sit until they are room temperature.<br>
                        Cold ingredients will result in a chunky batter.
                    </p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>Instructions</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Mixed the crushed graham crackres with 1/3 cup granulated sugar and the melted butter.</li>
                        <li>Mix until the mixture is even. The result will be thick, sandy, and coarse.</li>
                        <li>Pack crust mixture tightly to the bottom of the pan.</li>
                        <li>Beat the heavy cream in a bowl until stiff peaks form to create whipping cream.</li>
                        <li>Beat all remaining ingradients in a separate bowl.</li>
                        <li>Fold the whipping cream into the other bowl until the mixture is smooth.</li>
                        <li>
                            Refridgerate for 6-8 hours or overnight. Refridgerating for at least 12 hours will
                            result in a sturdier cheesecake.
                        </li>
                        <li>Adt toppings.</li>
                    </ol>
                    Now your beautiful, simple cheesecake is ready to serve!

                    <p>
                        <cite>Charlotte's Sweets Shop</cite> is celebrating its <b><em>7 year anniversary</em></b> this year. This is an important
                        number to Ms. Tomoe and the staff since it was at age 7 when Charlotte was diagnosed with an incurable illness and
                        only a year later that she passed away. Although unfortunate, she created something special. A shop, a community, and
                        delicious treats to share with the world. <q>This shop wouldn't exist without her. She is gone, but her
                        memory still lives on</q> says Ms. Tomoe, the shop owner.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We would like to honor her memory by releasing a cookbook filled with dishes, many of which were created by Charlotte.
                        Although a child, Charlotte was <em>incredibly talented</em>, in fact, more talented than most adults in the art of
                        baking and creating new recipes. I joined as a staff member 2 years ago, so I was not fortunate enough to have ever met
                        Charlotte in person. However, I have heard many stories of what a lovely young girl she was, and I could only
                        dream to have been able to meet such a wonderful person in my lifetime. Although I am quite new compared to
                        the staff members who have been working here for nearly the entire time the shop has been opened, I have been
                        treated as nothing but a close friend and family member in this community. This same love is poured into the
                        desserts we serve. Many of the treats we sell are original dishes by Charlotte and we know many of you are
                        excited to be able to create some of these dishes at home.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The book titled <cite>A Taste of Charlotte</cite> will be released on <time datetime="2020-12-19">December 19, 2020</time>,
                        the same day this shop opened 7 years ago. Please look forward to it!
